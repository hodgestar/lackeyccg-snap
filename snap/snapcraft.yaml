description: |
  LackeyCCG is a computer program used to play virtually any collectible card
  game (CCG) against online opponents or for building and testing of CCG decks
  offline in a solitaire mode[1]. It also allows for the searching of cards
  within each CCG. LackeyCCG currently has both Mac and Windows versions and
  will soon have a Linux version. The program was created by Trevor Agnitti and
  is currently in its beta testing stage.
